Q2/- Whatâ€™s the difference between class lock and object lock?
ANS:
**If a synchronized method is static then to access in this area we
need class level lock, but if a synchronized method is non static 
then to access it we need object level lock.

**object level lock is unique for each object and class level lock
is unique for each class.

Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .

ANS: We can suspend a thread in three ways timely,conditionally or un
conditionally.
when thread is suspended timely then it is by sleep method ,
ex:Thread.sleep(200),it will pause thread for some times.
If we want to suspend a thread conditionally then we use Thread.join() non 
static method, it will give the priority to the calling thread.
